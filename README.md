# PythonTypeInformation
The folder TYPE_REPO contains type information of commits of 1000 Python-ML projects.

## Folder structure
TYPE_REPO is the root folder. The next two child folders are the GitHub user name and the project name. For example, in the following example, the user name is scikit-learn, and the project name is scikit-learn. Inside the project name folder, you can find type information of each commit named with commit hex postfixed by N or O. The folders end with "N" contain the type information after the change, and the folder ends with O contain the type information after the change.

## Infer type information of new projects
You can use the python script [script_pytype_type_infer.py](https://github.com/mlcodepatterns/PythonTypeInformation/blob/master/script_pytype_type_infer.py) to infer type information of other projects. 


The steps outlined below leads you through inferring project type information of projects.
 
* You may make a new folder to hold all of the data as well as a virtual Python environment.
* 'cd' to the new folder
* execute `python3.7 -m venv ./VENV` to create new virtual environment 
* execute `source VENV/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment 
* execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`. [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mlcodepatterns/PythonTypeInformation/blob/master/requirements.txt) is available in the root folder of this repository
* execute `mkdir TYPE_REPO Pytypestorage GitHub`
* execute `python3 testpytype.py ./Pytypestorage/ ./GitHub/ ./TYPE_REPO/ author/project_name https://github.com/author/project_name.git`
  * > author/project_name is the GitHub full name of the project. e.g., maldil/MLEditsTest
  * > Inside the TYPE REPO folder, the new type information should be generated. To infer the results with new type information, update the folderÂ TYPE_REPO of the tools [Py-RefactoringMiner](https://github.com/maldil/RefactoringMiner) and [R-CPATMiner](https://github.com/maldil/R-CPATMiner).
